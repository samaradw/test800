## 🗃️ Step 4: Organize with categories

Time to clean things up!

### ✨ Why This Matters

Proper categorization keeps your Discussions easy to browse and reduces clutter. Just like GitHub Issues benefit from labels, Discussions benefit from clear categories. They’re critical for larger teams or public repositories.

### :keyboard: Activity: Organize your Discussion with categories

1. Go to a Discussion you created.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Change the category to something else (e.g. from “Q&A” to “Ideas”).
4. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) to automatically update to the next step.
