## ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Create a Discussion

Discussions are a great way to share updates, ask questions, or document decisions with your team. In this step, you'll create a GitHub Discussion to serve as the foundation for practicing pinning.

### âœ¨ Why this matters
Creating a Discussion gives your team a shared space to communicate asynchronously and transparently. Pinning starts with creating something worth highlighting.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a new Discussion

   > Practicing how to create and pin GitHub Discussions!
6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) to automatically update to the next step.
